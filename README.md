# Line Follower Robot Codes

This repository is dedicated to sharing code, theory, and documentation for Line Follower Robots (LFR) developed on different microcontroller platforms, such as Arduino Nano, ESP32, and STM32. These LFRs have participated in and won multiple robotics competitions.

## About

Line Follower Robots are autonomous robots that can follow a predefined path, usually a black line on a white surface, using various sensors and algorithms. The LFR is a classic robotics project that introduces key concepts in embedded systems, control theory, and sensor integration.

This repository aims to share not only the source codes for different platforms but also the underlying theory, sensor interfacing techniques, tuning methods, and competition strategies. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned robotics enthusiast, you'll find valuable resources to build, improve, and understand line follower robots.

## Platforms Covered

- **Arduino Nano**
- **ESP32**
- **STM32**
- *More platforms may be added in the future!*

## Repository Structure

- `/ArduinoNano/`: LFR codes and documentation for Arduino Nano.
- `/ESP32/`: LFR codes and documentation for ESP32.
- `/STM32/`: LFR codes and documentation for STM32.
- `/Theory/`: Articles, explanations, and diagrams about LFR principles, PID tuning, sensor choices, and competition tips.
- `/Docs/`: Circuit diagrams, hardware setup guides, and additional resources.

## Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred hardware platform.
2. Refer to the relevant folder for code, wiring diagrams, and setup instructions.
3. Upload the code to your microcontroller using the appropriate IDE (Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, STM32CubeIDE, etc.).
4. Experiment and optimize your robot!

## Why Share?

Having won many competitions with these LFRs, I believe in giving back to the robotics community. By sharing my experience and resources, I hope to inspire and help others build their own successful robots and foster a deeper understanding of robotics.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests, share your own LFR builds, or suggest improvements to the documentation.
